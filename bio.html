        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <article class="early">
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>Mustafa Kemal (under the name of Ali Rıza oğlu Mustafa which means “Mustafa son of Ali Rıza”) was born in early 1881 in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in Koca Kasım Paşa neighborhood in Selanik (now Thessaloniki), Ottoman Empire. His father, Ali Rıza Efendi, was a customs officer and later a lumber trader; while his mother Zübeyde Hanım is a conventional, devout but open-minded literate housewife. Only one of Mustafa’s five siblings survived childhood, a sister named Makbule (Atadan).
            Ali Rıza Efendi is thought to have been of Albanian origin by some authors, however according to Falih Rıfkı Atay, Vamık D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, Müjgân Cunbur, Numan Kartal and Hasan İzzettin Dinamo, Ali Rıza's ancestors were Yörük Turks, and ultimately descending from Söke in Aydın Province in Anatolia. His mother, Zübeyde Hanım, have been of Turkish origin, and according to Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, she was of Yörük ancestry too. Some other sources stated that he was Jewish, but if you look into his parents’ family tree both sides came from Muslim roots.</p>

          <article class="early">
            <h3>Primary Education</h3>
            <p>His parents have different opinion about his education, Zübeyde Hanım wants him to be a man of the cloth and go to local religious school but Ali Rıza Efendi wants him to go to Şemsi Efendi School, which is a newly opened, modern school with more secular curriculum. In the end, Ali Rıza Efendi came to a solution which ends the dispute. He will be started his education on local school then will be moved to Şemsi Efendi School but while he is in his new school, he lost his father(1888). After the death of Ali Rıza Efendi, Zübeyde Hanım moved in with her brother who is a butler in Rapla farm near Selanik because of financial difficulties.</p>

            <p>Zübeyde Hanım was saddened because the interruption of Mustafa’s education. She and his aunt decided and sent to him to his aunt’s home and enrolled a trade school. But he wants to be a soldier, so without consulting them he undertook the entrance exam for Selanik Askeri Rüştiyesi (Selanik Military School) in 1893. In his new school he was named “Kemal”(meaning perfection or maturity) by his mathematics teacher Üsküplü Mustafa Efendi. According to Affet İnan this was because the meaning of the name, but Ali Fuat Cebesoy states it was because his teacher wanted to distinguish his student who had the same name as him. Also, Andrew Mango (an English-Russian author and BBC employee) states he loves the Kemal name because of nationalist poet Namık Kemal and may have named himself as a tribute to him.</p>

            <p>After he finished his school in 1896, he enrolled to Manastır Military High School. And after finished high school, he enrolled to Ottoman Military College in Constantinople (modern İstanbul) on 14 March 1889 and graduated in 1902 with lieutenant rank. He continued his studies in Ottoman Military Academy and graduated with captain rank on 11 January 1905. While in Military Academy, Mustafa Kemal is interested in his country’s and nation’s problems. He and his friends published handprinted newspaper about freedom motivated articles, and how foreigner countries interfere in the internal affairs.</p>

        <h2>Military Career</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <article class="military">
            <h3>Early years</h3>
            <p>Shortly after graduation, he was arrested by police force for his anti-monarchist activities, mostly because of his newspaper. Following confinement for several months he was released only with the support of Rıza Paşa, his former school director. After his release, M. Kemal Fifth Army based in Damascus as a Staff Captain on 1905, in the company of Ali Fuat (Cebesoy) and Lütfi Müfit (Özdeş).  On the same year, M. Kemal, and his new friend Mustafa Elvan (Cantekin) started Vatan ve Hürriyet Cemiyeti (Community of Motherland & Liberty) along with Lütfi Müfit (Özdeş). Later he opened up branches on Beirut, Jaffa, and Jerusalem. In 1906, he secretly traveled to Selanik to open a new branch there. But for his efforts, he was arrested and after 4 months he returns to Syria. In 1907 he was promoted to the rank of Senior Captain (Kolağası) and on 13 October 1907, was assigned to the headquarters of the Third Army on Manastır. In 23 October of that year, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress, with membership number 322,  although in later years he became known for his opposition to, and frequent criticism of, the policies pursued by the CUP leadership.</p>

            <p>He was proposing depoliticization in the army, a proposal which was disliked by the leaders of the CUP. As a result, he was sent away to Tripolitania Vilayet (present Libya, then an Ottoman territory) under the pretext of suppressing a tribal rebellion towards the end of 1908. He suppressed the revolt and returned to Constantinople in January 1909.
            In April 1909 in Constantinople, a group of soldiers began a counter-revolution which will remember as 31 March Incident. M. Kemal was instrumental in supressing the revolt.
            In 1910, he was called to the Ottoman provinces in Albania. Later, in the autumn of 1910, he was among the Ottoman military observers who attended the Picardie army manoeuvres in France, and in 1911, served at the Ministry of War (Harbiye Nezareti) in Constantinople for a short time.</p>

          <article class="military">
            <h3>Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912)</h3>
            <p>In 1911, he volunteered to fight in the Italo-Turkish War in the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya). He served mainly in the areas near Derna and Tobruk. The invading Italian army had a strength of 150,000 men; it was opposed by 20,000 Bedouins and 8,000 Turks.</p>

            <p>A short time before Italy declared war, many of the Ottoman troops in Libya were sent to the Ottoman province of Yemen Vilayet to put down the rebellion there, so the Ottoman government was caught with inadequate resources to counter the Italians in Libya. Britain, which controlled the Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan, did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Atatürk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Atatürk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as at the Battle of Tobruk on 22 December 1911.</p>

            <p>During the Battle of Derna on 16–17 January 1912, while Atatürk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-ı Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a limestone splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atatürk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment On 6 March 1912, Atatürk became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. Atatürk, Enver Bey, Fethi Bey, and the other Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to Ottoman Europe following the outbreak of the Balkan Wars on 8 October 1912. Having lost the war, the Ottoman government had to surrender Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica (three provinces forming present-day Libya) to the Kingdom of Italy in the Treaty of Lausanne (1912) signed ten days later, on 18 October 1912 (since 1923, historians have preferred to name this treaty as the "Treaty of Ouchy", after the Château d'Ouchy in Lausanne where it was signed, to distinguish it from the later Treaty of Lausanne (1923) signed between the Allies of World War I and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in Ankara (at that time known as Angora).</p>

            <h3>Balkan Wars (1912-1913)</h3>
            <p>On 1 December 1912, Atatürk arrived at his new headquarters on the Gallipoli peninsula and, during the First Balkan War, he took part in the amphibious landing at Bulair on the coast of Thrace under Binbaşı Fethi Bey, but this offensive was repulsed during the Battle of Bulair by Georgi Todorov's 7th Rila Infantry Division under the command of Stiliyan Kovachev's Bulgarian Fourth Army.</p>

            <p>In June 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he took part in the Ottoman Army forces commanded by Kaymakam Enver Bey that recovered Dimetoka and Edirne (Adrianople, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire between 1365 and 1453, thus of utmost historic importance for the Turks) together with most of eastern Thrace from the Bulgarians.</p>

            <p>In 1913, he was appointed the Ottoman military attaché to all Balkan states (his office was in Sofia, Bulgaria) and promoted to the rank of Kaymakam (Lieutenant Colonel / Colonel) on 1 March 1914. While in Bulgaria, he met with Dimitrina Kovacheva, the daughter of Bulgarian general Stiliyan Kovachev (against whose forces he had fought during the Balkan Wars), who had recently completed her education in Switzerland, during a New Year's Eve ball in Sofia and fell in love with her. The two danced at the ball and started to secretly date in the following days. Atatürk twice asked Dimitrina's parents for their permission to marry her (the second time was in 1915, during World War I) and was twice refused, which left him with a lifelong sadness.</p>

            <h3>First World War (1914-1918)</h3>
            <p>In 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the European and Middle Eastern theatres of World War I allied with the Central Powers. Atatürk was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19th Division attached to the Fifth Army during the Battle of Gelibolu. He became the front-line commander after correctly anticipating where the Allies would attack and held his position until they retreated. </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk">
              <i>“Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place.”</i>- M. Kemal Paşa, 25 April 1915, Battle of Gelibolu
            </blockquote>

            <p>Following the Battle of Gallipoli, Atatürk served in Edirne until 14 January 1916. He was then assigned to the command of the XVI Corps of the Second Army and sent to the Caucasus Campaign after the massive Russian offensive had reached key Anatolian cities. On 7 August, he rallied his troops and mounted a counteroffensive. Two of his divisions captured Bitlis and Muş, upsetting the calculations of the Russian Command.</p>

            <p>Following this victory, the CUP government in Constantinople proposed to establish a new army in Hejaz (Hicaz Kuvve-i Seferiyesi) and appoint Atatürk to its command, but he refused the proposal, and this army was never established. Instead, on 7 March 1917, Atatürk was promoted from the command of the XVI Corps to the overall command of the Second Army, although the Czar's armies were soon withdrawn when the Russian Revolution erupted.</p>

            <p>In July 1917, he was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army, replacing Fevzi Pasha on 7 August 1917, who was under the command of the German general Erich von Falkenhayn's Yildirim Army Group (after the British forces of General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem in December 1917, Erich von Falkenhayn was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders who became the new commander of the Yıldırım Army Group in early 1918.) Atatürk did not get along well with General von Falkenhayn and, together with Miralay İsmet Bey, wrote a report to Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha regarding the grim situation and lack of adequate resources in the Palestinian front. However, Talaat Pasha ignored their observations and refused their suggestion to form a stronger defensive line to the north, in Ottoman Syria (in parts of the Beirut Vilayet, Damascus Vilayet, and Aleppo Vilayet), with Turks instead of Germans in command. Following the rejection of his report, Atatürk resigned from the Seventh Army and returned to Constantinople. There, he was assigned with the task of accompanying the crown prince (and future sultan) Mehmed Vahideddin during his train trip to Austria-Hungary and Germany. While in Germany, Atatürk visited the German lines on the Western Front and concluded that the Central Powers would soon lose the war. He did not hesitate to openly express this opinion to Kaiser Wilhelm II and his high-ranking generals in person. During the return trip, he briefly stayed in Karlsbad and Vienna for medical treatment. </p>

            <p>When Mehmed VI became the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in July 1918, he called Atatürk to Constantinople, and in August 1918, assigned him to the command of the Seventh Army in Palestine. Atatürk arrived in Aleppo on 26 August 1918, then continued south to his headquarters in Nablus. The Seventh Army was holding the central sector of the front lines. On 19 September, at the beginning of the Battle of Megiddo, the Eighth Army was holding the coastal flank but fell apart and Liman Pasha ordered the Seventh Army to withdraw to the north in order to prevent the British from conducting a short envelopment to the Jordan River. The Seventh Army retired towards the Jordan River but was destroyed by British aerial bombardment during its retreat from Nablus on 21 September 1918. Nevertheless, Atatürk managed to form a defence line to the north of Aleppo. According to Lord Kinross, Atatürk was the only Turkish general in the war who never suffered a defeat.</p>

            <p>The war ended with the Armistice of Mudros which was signed on 30 October 1918, and all German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Ottoman Empire were granted ample time to withdraw. On 31 October, Atatürk was appointed to the command of the Yıldırım Army Group, replacing Liman von Sanders. Atatürk organized the distribution of weapons to the civilians in Antep in case of a defensive conflict against the invading Allies.</p>

            <p>Atatürk's last active service in the Ottoman Army was organizing the return of the Ottoman troops left behind to the south of the defensive line. In early November 1918, the Yıldırım Army Group was officially dissolved, and Atatürk returned to an occupied Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, on 13 November 1918. For a period of time, he worked at the headquarters of the Ministry of War (Harbiye Nezareti) in Constantinople and continued his activities in this city until 16 May 1919. Along the established lines of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies (British, Italian, French, and Greek forces) occupied Anatolia. The occupation of Constantinople followed by the occupation of İzmir (the two largest Ottoman cities at the time) sparked the establishment of the Turkish National Movement and the Turkish War of Independence.</p>

            <h3>Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923)</h3>
            <p>On 30 April 1919, Fahri Yaver-i Hazret-i Şehriyari ("Honorary Aide-de-camp to His Majesty Sultan") Mirliva Atatürk was assigned as the inspector of the Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate to reorganize what remained of the Ottoman military units and to improve internal security. On 19 May 1919, he reached Samsun. His first goal was the establishment of an organized national movement against the occupying forces. In June 1919, he issued the Amasya Circular, declaring the independence of the country was in danger. He resigned from the Ottoman Army on 8 July, and the Ottoman government issued a warrant for his arrest. But Kâzım Karabekir and other military commanders active in Eastern Anatolia followed Atatürk's lead and acknowledged him as their leader. Later, he was condemned to death by Sultan.</p>

            <p>On 4 September 1919, he assembled a congress in Sivas. Those who opposed the Allies in various provinces in Turkey issued a declaration named Misak-ı Millî ("National Pact"). Atatürk was appointed as the head of the executive committee of the Congress. This gave him the legitimacy he needed for his future politics. </p>

            <p>The last election to the Ottoman parliament held in December 1919 gave a sweeping majority to candidates of the " Anadolu ve Rumeli Müdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti " (Association for Defence of Rights for Anatolia and Rumelia), headed by Atatürk, who himself remained in Angora, now known as Ankara. The fourth (and last) term of the parliament opened in Constantinople on 12 January 1920. It was dissolved by British forces on 18 March 1920, shortly after it adopted the Misak-ı Millî ("National Pact"). Atatürk called for a national election to establish a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora, the "Grand National Assembly" (GNA). On 23 April 1920, the GNA opened with Atatürk as the speaker; this act effectively created the situation of diarchy in the country. In May 1920, the power struggle between the two governments led to a death sentence in absentia for Mustafa Kemal by the Turkish courts-martial.</p>

            <p>On 10 August 1920, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha signed the Treaty of Sèvres, finalizing plans for the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, including the regions that Turkish nationals viewed as their heartland. Atatürk insisted on the country's complete independence and the safeguarding of interests of the Turkish majority on "Turkish soil". He persuaded the GNA to gather a National Army. The GNA army faced the Caliphate army propped up by the Allied occupation forces and had the immediate task of fighting the Armenian forces in the Eastern Front and the Greek forces advancing eastward from Smyrna (today known as İzmir) that they had occupied in May 1919, on the Western Front.</p>

            <p>The GNA military successes against the Democratic Republic of Armenia in the autumn of 1920 and later against the Greeks were made possible by a steady supply of gold and armaments to the Kemalists from the Russian Bolshevik government from the autumn of 1920 onwards.</p>

            <p>After a series of battles during the Greco-Turkish War, the Greek army advanced as far as the Sakarya River, just eighty kilometres west of the GNA. On 5 August 1921, Atatürk was promoted to commander in chief of the forces by the GNA. The ensuing Battle of Sakarya was fought from 23 August–13 September 1921 and ended with the defeat of the Greeks. After this victory, Atatürk was given the rank of Mareşal and the title of Gazi by the Grand National Assembly on 19 September 1921. The Allies, ignoring the extent of Atatürk's successes, hoped to impose a modified version of the Treaty of Sèvres as a peace settlement on Angora, but the proposal was rejected. In August 1922, Atatürk launched an all-out attack on the Greek lines at Afyonkarahisar in the Battle of Dumlupınar, and Turkish forces regained control of İzmir on 9 September 1922. On 10 September 1922, Atatürk sent a telegram to the League of Nations stating that the Turkish population was so worked up that the Ankara Government would not be responsible for the ensuing massacres.</p>

            <p>The Conference of Lausanne began on 21 November 1922. Turkey, represented by İsmet İnönü of the GNA, refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty, such as the control of Turkish finances, the Capitulations, the Straits, and other issues. Although the conference paused on 4 February, it continued after 23 April mainly focusing on the economic issues. On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed by the Powers with the GNA, thus recognising the latter as the government of Turkey.</p>

            <p>On 29 October 1923, the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed. Since then, Republic Day has been celebrated as a national holiday on that date.</p>

            <h2>Political Career & Presidency</h2>
            <p>With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, efforts to modernise the country started with electing a president with democratic ways, and Mustafa Kemal elected as president in 1923. The new government analysed the institutions and constitutions of Western states such as France, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland and adapted them to the needs and characteristics of the Turkish nation. Highlighting the public's lack of knowledge regarding Atatürk's intentions, the public cheered: "We are returning to the days of the first caliphs." Atatürk placed Fevzi Çakmak, Kâzım Özalp, and İsmet İnönü in political positions where they could institute his reforms. He capitalized on his reputation as an efficient military leader and spent the following years, up until his death in 1938, instituting political, economic, and social reforms. In doing so, he transformed Turkish society from perceiving itself as a Muslim part of a vast Empire into a modern, democratic, and secular nation-state. This had a positive influence on human capital because from then on, what mattered at school was science and education; Islam was concentrated in mosques and religious places.</p>

            <h3>Domestic Policies</h3>
            <p>Atatürk's basic tenet was the complete independence of the country. He clarified his position:</p>
            <p><i>“...by complete independence, we mean of course complete economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural independence and freedom in all matters. Being deprived of independence in any of these is equivalent to the nation and country being deprived of all its independence.”</i></p>

            <p>He led wide-ranging reforms in social, cultural, and economic aspects, establishing the new Republic's backbone of legislative, judicial, and economic structures. Though he was later idealized by some as an originator of sweeping reforms, many of his reformist ideas were already common in Ottoman intellectual circles at the turn of the 20th century and were expressed more openly after the Young Turk Revolution.</p>

            <p>Atatürk created a banner to mark the changes between the old Ottoman and the new republican rule. Each change was symbolized as an arrow in this banner. This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the "Six Arrows", or Kemalism. Kemalism is based on Atatürk's conception of realism and pragmatism. The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and etatism were all defined under the Six Arrows. These fundamentals were not new in world politics or, indeed, among the elite of Turkey. What made them unique was that these interrelated fundamentals were explicitly formulated for Turkey's needs. A good example is the definition and application of secularism; the Kemalist secular state significantly differed from predominantly Christian states.</p>

            <p>After the acceptance of Surname Law, GNA gave Atatürk (literally father of Turks)surname to Mustafa Kemal.</p>

            <p>We can group reforms of Atatürk under these topics:</p>

            <h3>Illness & Death</h3>
            <p>Throughout most of his life, Atatürk was a moderate-to-heavy drinker, often consuming half a litre of rakı a day; he also smoked tobacco, predominantly in the form of cigarettes. During 1937, indications that Atatürk's health was worsening started to appear. In early 1938, while on a trip to Yalova, he suffered from a serious illness. He went to Istanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with cirrhosis. During his stay in Istanbul, he made an effort to keep up with his regular lifestyle, but eventually succumbed to his illness. He died on 10 November 1938, at the age of 57, in the Dolmabahçe Palace. He was the first president of Turkey to die in office. The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to the time of his death, 9:05 in the morning.</p>

            <p>Atatürk's funeral called forth both sorrow and pride in Turkey, and 17 countries sent special representatives, while nine contributed armed detachments to the cortège. Atatürk's remains were originally laid to rest in the Ethnography Museum of Ankara, but they were transferred on 10 November 1953 (15 years after his death) in a 42-ton sarcophagus to a mausoleum overlooking Ankara, Anıtkabir.</p>

            <p>In his will, Atatürk donated all of his possessions to the Republican People's Party, provided that the yearly interest of his funds would be used to look after his sister Makbule and his adopted children and fund the higher education of İsmet İnönü's children. The remainder of this yearly interest was willed to the Turkish Language Association and the Turkish Historical Society.</p>
