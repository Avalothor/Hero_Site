      <h2>Why Atatürk as my Hero?</h2>
      <p>As a proud Turkish young, I saw much hate for our leader and I want to share my knowledge and viewpoint to anyone who wants to learn about Ataturk.</p>
      <p>Some people say bad things about him because they think because of their religious view, and some says because of some grudge they don't know what started, or when started. If one can leave their side and look at the man himself in objective point, one can see how brilliant Mustafa Kemal is. He is not just some warlord, a wannabe dictator or mere man. He knows how to and when to fight, as a soldier, he knows the war only brings destruction.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk">
        <i>Milletin hayatı tehlikeye maruz kalmadıkça, savaş bir cinayettir. (Unless a nation's life faces peril, war is murder.)</i> - Atatürk

      <p>He knows education is more important than just winning a war and taking steps on this way, even on trenches of war. He knows learning does not have a place or time, that's why he carries books with him to front to front. He knows the importance of people and their enlightenement. That's why he changed the letters to keep up with west and also make it easy to learn unlike old arabic letters of complex Ottoman language.</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr5we_QaHsc" id="tedtalksteacher">Here a teacher committed to the ways of him explains his thoughts.</a>
      <p>If I am now in Ireland and studying. This is because of him and his farsighted friends. This is because the lifes given to defend our homeland. If we can now talk our own language, which is dated all the way to Asia to our ancestors, not English, French or some other community's language, that is because of our Ata's (Ancestors)</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk">
        <i>Hattı müdafaa yoktur, sathı müdafaa vardır. O satıh bütün vatandır. (There is no defense line, but defense territory. This territory is the whole of the motherland!)</i> - Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
      </blockquote>
      <p>And because of these reasons a shiver went down my spine everytime I think, talk, look at him:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/290228-to-see-me-does-not-necessarily-mean-to-see-my">
        <i>Beni görmek demek mutlaka yüzümü görmek değildir. Benim fikirlerimi, benim duygularımı anlıyorsanız ve hissediyorsanız bu kafidir.(To see me does not necessarily mean to see my face. To understand my thoughts is to have seen me.)</i> - Atatürk
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
        İki Mustafa Kemal var. Biri ben, fert olan, fani olan Mustafa Kemal. İkinci Mustafa Kemal'den ise ancak "Biz" diye bahsedebilirim. Yani sizler, çalışan köylü, uyanık, münevver, milliyetperver vatandaşlar... İşte o Mustafa Kemal ölmez.(There are two Mustafa Kemals. One the flesh-and-blood Mustafa Kemal who now stands before you and who will pass away. The other is you, all of you here who will go to the far corners of our land to spread the ideals which must be defended with your lives if necessary. I stand for the nation's dreams, and my life's work is to make them come true.) - Atatürk
