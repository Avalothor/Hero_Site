The sincere tears that people from all classes have shed, are nothing more than the true reflection of this great man - the Father of the modern Turkey.
        The sincere tears shed after him by all classes of people is nothing other than an appropriate manifestation to this great hero and modern Turkey's Ata.”</i>  - Winston Churchill
