After 1926, management of the farm was offered to Spiritual Christians from Russia living in north Kars Province noted for animal breeding (Malakan horse, Malakan cow), who refused repatriation to Soviet Union, and declined to move to Ankara, because the most zealous believed they must live close to Mt. Ararat for the Second Coming of Christ. In 1937, Atatürk donated the farm to the Turkish state. At the farm is an exact replica of the house, where Atatürk was born in 1881 in Selânik, Ottoman Empire.</p>
